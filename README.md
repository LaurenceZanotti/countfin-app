# Countfin App - Accounting control made easy

This app is made with vanilla JavaScript for study purposes. Also props to @bradtraversy and his youtube channel, Traversy Media, which helped me with the core functionality (adding itens to the list).

After some research I was able to create my first item search feature using MDN JS documentation and other fonts. Then added an edit content using the HTML5 attribute contentEditable and interacting with it using JavaScript, also indicating to user that he is editing the line through UI changes (bootstrap interaction).

While doing all this, I wanted to have better control of the project, learn more about version control and software development life cycle, workflows and etc, then I decided to learn Git and GitHub.

Hope to learn more about web development with this project and GitHubs features. Every feedback is extreme valuable.
