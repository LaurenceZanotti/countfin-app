# Countfin App - Simple for account management

This app is made with vanilla JavaScript for study purposes. Also props to @bradtraversy and his youtube channel, Traversy Media, which helped me with the core functionality (adding and deleting items of the list).

After some research I was able to create my first item search feature using MDN JS documentation and other resources. Then added an edit button using the HTML5 attribute contentEditable and interacting with it using JavaScript, indicating the user which line he is editing through UI changes (bootstrap interaction).

I hope to learn tons of fundamentals with this project, and specially get used to Git and Github tools to improve my workflow.

Hope to learn more about web development with this project and GitHubs features. Every feedback is extreme valuable.
